If you can help improve these unofficial docs, I'd massively appreciate your
help! Feel free to fork, make improvements, then create a pull request.

## Style

Please try to stick to the documentation style used by the project so far.
Write docstrings such that they render correctly as Markdown, both in VS Code's
tooltips, and within `pdoc`.
