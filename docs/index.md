This website contains documentation for functions and classes used in FL
Studio's Python API. This includes modules used within:

* [MIDI Controller Scripting](midi_controller_scripting/index.md) - interact
  with MIDI controllers to add advanced integration with FL Studio.

* [Edison Audio Scripting](edison_scripting/index.md) - modify and interact
  with audio in the Edison audio editor to do weird and wonderful things with
  your audio clips.

* [Piano Roll Scripting](piano_roll_scripting/index.md) - modify and interact
  with notes and markers in the piano roll to efficiently generate, warp, and
  mangle the contents of the piano roll.

Additionally, the function documentation can be accessed as an installable
Python package. For more information, see the
[library documentation](library.md).
