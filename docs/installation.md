# Installing the FL Studio API Stubs

To avoid module conflicts with other Python projects, it is recommended that
you install this script in a virtual environment by following
[these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in the
official Python documentation.

After activating the environment in your terminal, you can install the stub
modules by running the command `pip install fl-studio-api-stubs` on Windows or
`pip3 install fl-studio-api-stubs` on MacOS or Linux.
