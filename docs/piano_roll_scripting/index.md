# Piano roll scripting

Piano roll scripting allows you to interact with and modify notes and markers
on the FL Studio piano roll.

For support and to share your work, check out the
[Piano roll scripting forum](https://forum.image-line.com/viewforum.php?f=2008).

Scripts should be placed in the `Image-Line/FL Studio/Settings/Piano roll scripts`
directory.

Main script files should use the `.pyscript` file extension, with additional
modules using standard `.py` files.

Additional scripts are located in the following directories:

* `Image-Line/Downloads/Piano roll scripts`: browser script downloads.

* `FL Studio 21/Contents/Resources/FL/System/Config/Piano roll scripts`:
  built-in scripts.

## Module reference

* [`flpianoroll`](flpianoroll): main module for piano roll scripting.
