# Edison scripting

Edison audio scripting can be used to analyze, manipulate and generate audio
within the [Edison audio editor](https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio-learning/fl-studio-online-manual/html/plugins/Edison.htm).

Edison scripts can be placed within the
`Image-Line/FL Studio/Settings/Audio scripts` directory.

Main script files should use the `.pyscript` file extension, with additional
modules using standard `.py` files.

## Module reference

* [`enveditor`](./enveditor): edit waveforms in Edison.
