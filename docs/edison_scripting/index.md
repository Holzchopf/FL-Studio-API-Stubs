# Env Editor

FL Studio built-in module.

This module provides editing tools for interacting with audio clips in the
Edison editor, using its integrated scripts functionality.

Main script files should use the `.pyscript` file extension, with additional
modules using standard `.py` files.

Note that this module is not accessible in MIDI Controller Scripts, it can only
be used in scripts that run in Edison's editor.
