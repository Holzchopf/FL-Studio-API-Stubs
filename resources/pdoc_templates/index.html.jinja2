# FL Studio API Documentation

This is user-written documentation for FL Studio's Python API. It contains
information on how to use the API to interact with FL Studio. As well as this,
it is also available as an installable package, which allows you to write code
for FL Studio with the help of smart suggestions and inline documentation. Both
the online documentation and the installable package use the same definitions,
meaning that they share the same detailed and helpful information.

If you wish to help contribute to this documentation, you can do so by creating
a pull request to
[this repository](https://github.com/MiguelGuthridge/FL-Studio-API-Stubs).
