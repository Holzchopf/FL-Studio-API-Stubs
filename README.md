# FL Studio MIDI Python API

This project contains simple stub functions to provide intellisense while
working on scripts for FL Studio's MIDI Python API.

Currently, it only provides function definitions and docstrings, but these
functions don't do anything. It is NOT a complete testing framework, and it
cannot guarantee your script will work correctly. However, it may help you to
resolve issues with incorrect function calls when interacting with the API.

# Installation

To avoid module conflicts with other Python projects, it is recommended that you
install this script in a virtual environment by following 
[these instructions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in the 
official Python documentation.

After activating the environment in your editor, you can install the stub 
modules by running the command `pip3 install [MODULE-NAME]`.
